    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Although some of restaurants are chains and working with professional mentality, the majority of them are small or medium business and they do not have professional support for their potantional orders. Also, even if some of rastaurants are only working with advance booking, they still can not have certain ideas aobut customer's order. Due to that, it is hardly possible to predict about their orders. Restaurants can order anything and anytime, therefore, the location of their warehouse must be as close as possible the district where the restaurants are intensively located. </li><li>The wholesale business are being done with low profitability ratio and high costs. Therefore, the company would like to work with fixed expenses which are as low as possible, however, they do not want to compromise on customer satisfaction. </li><li>Although their potential clients are high probably located in central places, you can rarely find the warehouse facilities in central areas with low rent costs.</li>\n",
