The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.\n",

    "<li>We will take into consideration locations with restaurants in radius of 500 meters, </ul>\n"
